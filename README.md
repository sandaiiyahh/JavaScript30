# JavaScript30 Challenge

After bootcamp, I aim to continue practicing my JavaScript skills so I decided to partake in Wes Bos's [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) Challenge.
The projects are created with vanilla JS with no use of frameworks, libraries, boilerplates, or compilers. 

### **Start Date**: 4/14/2021
### **End Date**: TBD

# Projects
### 1. [JavaScript Drum Kit](https://github.com/sandaiiyahh/JavaScript30/tree/main/01-JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit)
